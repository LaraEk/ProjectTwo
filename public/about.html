      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Pet Adoption">

<p>Adoppopotamus is a non-profit that helps homeless pets find their way into their forever homes through rescue and adoption.</p>

<p>We offer two-weeks or monthly trials. Remember: Dogs and cats who are taken into the care of shelters and rescue groups each year find themselves homeless through no fault of their own; “moving” and “landlord issues” are the top reasons people give up their pets.</p>

<p>Through us, you can adopt any kind of pet, whether it's an elephant or a kangaroo!</p>

<p>Contact us today for more info!</p>
