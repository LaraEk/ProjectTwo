# ProjectTwo
second project for GW Coding Bootcamp

In this second project for GW Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, Team Amazons has put together a Pet Adoption Site.  We give the user the option of adopting both real and imaginary pets - the real being existing animals, the imaginary being creatures from myth, legend, and popular media - via a contact form and confirmation.
